# üéØ Solution Submission Guidelines

> **How to submit your solutions to Python practice questions**

Welcome to the Python Atelier! This guide will help you submit your solutions to practice questions and contribute to this collaborative learning atelier.

---

## üìÅ Solution Structure

Each topic folder contains a `solutions/` directory where you'll submit your answers:

```
topic_folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ questions.md          # Practice questions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # Topic overview
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ solutions/           # Your solutions go here
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ question_01.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ question_02.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## üìù How to Submit Your Solution

### 1. **Choose a Question**

- Browse through any topic folder (e.g., `01_variables_and_data_types/`)
- Open `questions.md` to see all practice questions
- Pick a question you want to solve

### 2. **Create Your Solution File**

- Navigate to the `solutions/` folder in that topic
- Create a new Python file: `question_XX.py` (replace XX with question number)
- Use the appropriate template below based on what you know

### 3. **Solution File Templates**

Choose the template based on your current Python knowledge level:

#### üü¢ **Template A: Absolute Beginner**

```python
"""
Question X: [Question Title]
Difficulty: ‚≠ê
Category: [Category]

[Copy the full question text here]

This solution uses only variables and print statements.
Use this template if you have only learned about variables.
"""

# ===========================================
# STEP 1: Create your variables
# ===========================================

# Create variables with the data you want to work with
my_number = 42
my_text = "hello"
my_decimal = 3.14

# ===========================================
# STEP 2: Print your variables
# ===========================================

print("My variables contain:")
print("my_number =", my_number)
print("my_text =", my_text)
print("my_decimal =", my_decimal)

# ===========================================
# STEP 3: Try to solve the question
# ===========================================

# Add your solution logic here
# Use print() to show your results
print("\nMy solution:")
# Write your answer here
```

#### üü° **Template B: Intermediate**

```python
"""
Question X: [Question Title]
Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Category: [Category]

[Copy the full question text here]

Example:
    function_name("input") -> "expected_output"
"""

def your_function_name():
    """
    TODO: Write what your function does
    """
    # TODO: Write your solution here
    pass

# Test your solution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Testing your solution...")
    # TODO: Add test cases here
    # Example: result = your_function_name("test_input")
    # Example: print(f"Result: {result}")
```

#### üî¥ **Template C: Expert**

```python
"""
Question X: [Question Title]
Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Category: [Category]

[Copy the full question text here]

Example:
    function_name("input") -> "expected_output"
"""

from typing import Any, Optional

def your_function_name(param: Any) -> str:
    """
    Detailed description of what your function does.

    Args:
        param: Description of the parameter

    Returns:
        Description of the return value

    Raises:
        ValueError: When something goes wrong

    Examples:
        >>> your_function_name("test")
        'expected_output'
    """
    # TODO: Write your solution here
    pass

# Comprehensive testing
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Running comprehensive tests...")

    # Test cases
    test_cases = [
        ("input1", "expected1"),
        ("input2", "expected2"),
    ]

    for test_input, expected in test_cases:
        result = your_function_name(test_input)
        status = "‚úÖ" if result == expected else "‚ùå"
        print(f"{status} {test_input} -> {result} (expected: {expected})")
```

### 4. **Code Quality Requirements**

#### üü¢ **Template A (Absolute Beginner):**

‚úÖ **Must Include:**

- Variables with meaningful names
- Print statements to show your work
- Comments explaining what you're doing

‚úÖ **Code Style:**

- Use clear variable names
- Add comments to explain your steps
- Test your code by running it

#### üü° **Template B (Intermediate):**

‚úÖ **Must Include:**

- Clear function names
- Basic docstrings
- Simple test cases
- Comments explaining complex logic

‚úÖ **Code Style:**

- Follow basic Python conventions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

#### üî¥ **Template C (Expert):**

‚úÖ **Must Include:**
