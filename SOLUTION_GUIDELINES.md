# üéØ Solution Submission Guidelines

> **How to submit your solutions to Python practice questions**

Welcome to the Python Dojo! This guide will help you submit your solutions to practice questions and contribute to this collaborative learning resource.

## üìÅ Solution Structure

Each topic folder contains a `solutions/` directory where you'll submit your answers:

```
topic_folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ questions.md          # Practice questions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # Topic overview
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ solutions/           # Your solutions go here
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ question_01.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ question_02.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## üìù How to Submit Your Solution

### 1. **Choose a Question**

- Browse through any topic folder (e.g., `01_variables_and_data_types/`)
- Open `questions.md` to see all practice questions
- Pick a question you want to solve

### 2. **Create Your Solution File**

- Navigate to the `solutions/` folder in that topic
- Create a new Python file: `question_XX.py` (replace XX with question number)
- Use the template below

### 3. **Solution File Template**

```python
"""
Question X: [Question Title]
Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Category: [Category]

[Copy the full question text here]

Example:
    function_name("input") -> "expected_output"
"""

# Your solution here
def your_function_name():
    # Write your solution
    pass

# Test your solution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Add test cases to verify your solution
    print("Testing your solution...")
    # result = your_function_name("test_input")
    # print(f"Result: {result}")
```

### 4. **Code Quality Requirements**

‚úÖ **Must Include:**

- Clear function/class names
- Type hints (where applicable)
- Docstrings for functions/classes
- Test cases in `if __name__ == "__main__":`
- Comments explaining complex logic

‚úÖ **Code Style:**

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Handle edge cases appropriately

‚ùå **Avoid:**

- Hardcoded values without explanation
- Overly complex one-liners
- Missing error handling
- Poor variable naming
