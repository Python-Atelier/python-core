# ### Question 3: Basic Math with Variables ⭐

# **⏱️ Time Estimate:** 5 minutes  
# **🎯 Category:** Numbers  
# **📝 Skills Tested:** Arithmetic operations

# **Task:** Use variables to perform simple calculations.

# **What to do:**

# - Create two number variables (like `a = 10` and `b = 5`)
# - Add them together and store the result in a new variable
# - Subtract them and store the result
# - Multiply them and store the result
# - Print all results


# **Think about:**

# - Can you use the same variable name for different results?
# - What happens if you change the values of `a` and `b`?

num_1 = 22
num_2 = 33
add_result = num_1 + num_2
subtract_result = num_2 - num_1
multiply_result = num_1 * num_2

print(f"result of addition of {num_1} and {num_2} is : {add_result}")
print(f"result of subtract of {num_1} and {num_2} is : {subtract_result}")
print(f"result of multiply of {num_1} and {num_2} is : {multiply_result}")
