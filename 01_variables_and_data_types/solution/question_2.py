# ### Question 2: Understanding Different Data Types ⭐

# **⏱️ Time Estimate:** 5 minutes  
# **🎯 Category:** Data Types  
# **📝 Skills Tested:** String, integer, float, boolean

# **Task:** Create variables of different data types and check their types.

# **What to do:**

# - Create a string variable (text in quotes)
# - Create an integer variable (whole number)
# - Create a float variable (decimal number)
# - Create a boolean variable (True or False)
# - Use `type()` to check what type each variable is


# **Think about:**

# - What's the difference between `42` and `"42"`?
# - When would you use each data type?


name = "Mayank Priy"
age = 30
weight = 85.5
is_employed = True


print(f"Type of the varibale name is: {type(name)}")
print(f"Type of the varibale age is: {type(age)}")
print(f"Type of the varibale weight is: {type(weight)}")
print(f"Type of the varibale is_employed is: {type(is_employed)}")
