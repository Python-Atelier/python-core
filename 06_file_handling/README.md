## 🚀 **Modern Python Features (2025)**

### ✨ **Pathlib for Modern File Operations**

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List, Dict

def process_data_files(directory: Path) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
    """Process all data files in a directory using pathlib."""
    results = {}

    # Find all data files
    for file_path in directory.glob("*.txt"):
        try:
            # Read file content
            content = file_path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')

            # Process content
            lines = content.splitlines()
            results[file_path.stem] = [
                line.strip() for line in lines
                if line.strip() and not line.startswith('#')
            ]

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing {file_path}: {e}")

    return results

# Usage
data_dir = Path("data")
results = process_data_files(data_dir)
```

### 🎯 **Async File Operations**

```python
import asyncio
import aiofiles
from pathlib import Path

async def async_file_processor(file_path: Path) -> str:
    """Process files asynchronously."""
    async with aiofiles.open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        content = await file.read()
        return content.upper()

async def process_multiple_files(file_paths: List[Path]) -> List[str]:
    """Process multiple files concurrently."""
    tasks = [async_file_processor(path) for path in file_paths]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# Usage
file_paths = [Path(f"file_{i}.txt") for i in range(5)]
results = asyncio.run(process_multiple_files(file_paths))
```

### 🔍 **Advanced File Processing**

```python
import json
import csv
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any, Dict, List

class FileProcessor:
    """Advanced file processing with multiple formats."""

    @staticmethod
    def read_json(file_path: Path) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Read JSON file with error handling."""
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                return json.load(file)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            print(f"JSON decode error in {file_path}: {e}")
            return {}

    @staticmethod
    def write_csv(data: List[Dict[str, Any]], file_path: Path) -> None:
        """Write data to CSV file."""
        if not data:
            return

        fieldnames = data[0].keys()
        with open(file_path, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)
            writer.writeheader()
            writer.writerows(data)

    @staticmethod
    def process_large_file(file_path: Path, chunk_size: int = 1024) -> str:
        """Process large files in chunks."""
        result = ""
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            while chunk := file.read(chunk_size):
                result += chunk.upper()
        return result
```
